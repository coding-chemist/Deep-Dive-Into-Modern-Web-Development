# Full Stack Open: Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development

This repository contains learning materials and exercises for the "Full Stack Open" course, offered by the University of Helsinki. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to **modern JavaScript-based web development**, with a primary focus on building **Single-Page Applications (SPAs)** using **ReactJS** that interact with **REST APIs** built with **Node.js**.

## Course Overview

The course is designed to take you on a deep dive into full-stack web development, covering both client-side and server-side aspects, along with database integration.

### What is Full-Stack Web Development?
Full-stack web development, in the context of this course, refers to focusing on all "layers" of a web application: the **frontend (browser, JavaScript)**, the **backend (server)**, and often a **database layer** below the server. The course primarily uses JavaScript for both frontend and backend development (with Node.js), although using the same language across all layers is not a strict requirement for full-stack development.

## Key Technologies and Stacks Covered

The course equips you with skills in the following modern web technologies:

*   **Frontend**:
    *   **ReactJS**: The main focus for building single-page applications.
    *   **Redux**: Frequently used alongside React for advanced state management.
    *   **JavaScript (modern)**: The core language used across the stack.
    *   **CSS**: For styling web applications.
    *   **Webpack**: Used for managing and bundling assets.
    *   **React Native**: Covered for mobile application development.
    *   **TypeScript**: Introduced for enhanced type safety and maintainability.
*   **Backend**:
    *   **Node.js**: The JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side programming.
    *   **Express**: A popular Node.js library used to create web servers and REST APIs.
    *   **GraphQL**: An alternative to REST for API development.
*   **Databases**:
    *   **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database, often used with Node.js applications.
    *   **Relational Databases**: Covered in later parts of the course.
*   **Development Practices**:
    *   **Testing**: Strategies for testing both Express servers and React applications are taught.
    *   **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**: Modern software delivery practices.
    *   **Containers**: Principles of containerization for deploying applications.

## Course Structure (Parts)

The course is divided into several parts, each focusing on specific aspects of web development:

*   **Part 2: Communicating with server**
*   **Part 3: Programming a server with NodeJS and Express**
*   **Part 4: Testing Express servers, user administration**
*   **Part 5: Testing React apps**
*   **Part 6: Advanced state management**
*   **Part 7: React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack**
*   **Part 8: GraphQL**
*   **Part 9: TypeScript**
*   **Part 10: React Native**
*   **Part 11: CI/CD**
*   **Part 12: Containers**
*   **Part 13: Using relational databases**
